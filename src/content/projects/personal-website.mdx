This is a personal website to showcase the work I have done.

##### Why Gatsby.js?
Fast.
It uses Server Side Generator. It merges data and creates HTML pages that are deployed to the server as static files. This reduces the latency compare to sites run by databases experience.

##### Personal Website?
I started this project to record my journey as a computer science and a photographer. I enjoy both coding and photography, what is a better way than making a website to showcase both of these!

As a person who is meticulous about design. What is a better way than creating a website from scratch to build up my personal profilo and to cultivate art sense in computer science.
