#### **Motivation**
I started this project to record my journey as a computer science and a photographer. I enjoy both coding and photography,
making a website to showcase both of them is the first thing that come to mind!

As a person who is meticulous about design. What is a better way than creating a website from scratch to build up my personal portfolio
and to cultivate art sense in computer science.

##### Why Gatsby.js?
Fast.
It uses Server Side Generator. It merges data and creates `HTML` pages that are deployed to the server as static files.
This reduces the latency compare to sites run by databases experience.

#### **Description**
This is a personal website to showcase the work I have done, including coding projects, photography, videography.
