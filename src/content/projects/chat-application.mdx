#### **Motivation**
Chat applications are very common nowadays, we use them every day.\
But is developing a chat application *that* easy?\
Or is it easier said than done?

I am here to find out.

The main technology I want to explore is `Websocket`, which allows real time updates between clients.\
A truly fascinating technology, before `Websocket`, we need to use `RESTful APIs` to do long polling or short polling,
which is inefficient and creates a huge server load.

**1. Frontend**\
`Angular` was never as dominant in the market as `React.js`.\
But in fact, `Angular` is still a very popular choice among enterprise level applications.

Why is that?

`Angular` offered a lot more than `React.js` out of the box. The most apparent one is the router, you have to install
plugin to use router in `React.js`, but `Angular` has router built in.

**2. Backend**\
I have always been a `Spring Boot` developer, which is a very all-rounded backend framework. However, it is considered
quite heavily weighted compared to many other frameworks. Therefore, `Kotlin` is a `JVM` Language that aims to replace `Java`.
I would like to see how was it if I were to develop in a lightweight framework like `Ktor`

#### **Description**
This chat application allows users to chat in real time using Websocket connections.\
Users can also search for their desired chats, as well as create a new chat with someone new.
