The Green Project, where I use `Vue.js`, `Spring Boot` and `Mongo DB` as the tech stack of this project.

Hirers are able to submit job requirements to the website with desired skills and job description.
Job Seekers are able to view jobs with corresponding job titles and requirements.

I am still currently working on it!\
Stay tuned!
