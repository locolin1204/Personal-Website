#### **Motivation**
This is my first full-stack project to build from scratch.
This project is mainly for me to experiment different technologies and learn about the integration between, frontend, backend and database.

**1. Frontend**\
The popularity of `Vue.js` is rising quickly in recent years, being a `React.js` developer, I want to dive deeper to see
the mechanics behind `Vue.js`.

**2. Backend**\
`Spring Boot` has always been a solid choice for the backend, by building the backend from scratch, I want to brush up on the best practice
and see what `Spring Boot` has to offer.

**3. Database**\
`MongoDB` has always been a popular choice for `NoSQL` databases, coming from a `SQL` background, I want to learn the pros and cons
of `NoSQL`.

**4. DevOps**\
CI/CD could provide much convenience when developing an application, with that said, I integrated with `GitHub Action`, `Docker` and `AWS` for the
deployment pipeline.
