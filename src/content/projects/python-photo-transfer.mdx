I created this script to simplify my photo transfer process.

I coded with both `Python` and `AppleScript` to provide the most convenient way to transfer photos.

With a click of a button, it will trigger AppleScript, the script will trigger the Python script. The program will get today's date and check if the corresponding, year and month directory is created. If not, the directories will be created. Then, it will ask user for the name of the folder. Finally, it will show the current progress in percentage together with the transferred and total files.
