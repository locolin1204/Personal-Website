#### **Motivation**
This is a group project from a course in CUHK, where we created a full-stack online shopping platform.\
Our team outperformed other teams, attaining the ***highest*** score among all.

We developed our application in different phase.\
Just like all other software, we didn't dive right into the development, we planned and designed different documents beforehand.

###### 4. Development

together with Infrastructure as Code with `Terraform`.
