In this project, it visualizes the upcoming 9 days of weather in Hong Kong.

Visualization on how the minimum and maximum temperature changes over the next 9 days would be interesting as well as how the weather condition changes, e.g. sunny, rainy.

For the current brainstorm, I am planning to visualize the changes of weather in a bar chart with each of the bars showing the current weather conditions, e.g. temperature, humidity, etc. Then, each bar will have different colors based on their values, e.g. bars with higher temperature will appear orange, and bars with lower temperature will appear blue. Moreover, time allows. I would like to make a visualization on the current weather using the API provided by the Hong Kong Observatory, e.g. having a bar of maximum and minimum temperature of today and placing the current temperature between it. Furthermore, placing this programme on the web would also be an interesting side project for myself to learn, therefore, I may also build a web app to show these visualizations online.
