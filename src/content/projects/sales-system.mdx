This a group project which we made a Sales System program to emulate real life transactions.

We first design the data schema for the sales system, then we implemented a sales system for a computer part store so that all information about transactions, computer parts and salespersons is stored. The system supports interactive inquiries from users. The system uses Java JDBC API and MySQL database system.
