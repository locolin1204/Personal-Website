#### **Motivation**
This is a group project from a course in the training program of Nomura, where we created a full-stack straight through processing system for users to mimic executing trades.

Our project was given very limited initial guidance, and requiring us to independently explore different methodologies ourselves.

Our development timeline was also really packed, we were only given around a little more than 10 hours officially in total to complete the entire project.

Given most team members had limited prior knowledge of finance, it was particular challenging to fully understanding and
deliver a quality outcome within such a constrained timeframe.

#### **Role**
I am the **full stack developer** and the **UI designer** in the team.\
Focusing mainly on the backend services with `Spring Boot` and `PostgreSQL` and the frontend development with `Next.js`.

<br />

#### **Description**
The goal of this project is to create a real-time straight-through processing system.
