One of the highlights of my internship was the opportunity to present my projects to the senior leadership team and my peers.

It was a challenging and immensely rewarding experience that allowed me to showcase what I have learnt and the value I brought to the team.

I also collaborate with the team and the traders to build a
full-stack application for traders to enhance market decisions, 
as well as built an automated test suite to enhance the deployment pipeline.
