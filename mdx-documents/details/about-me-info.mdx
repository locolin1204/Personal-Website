I love solving problems creatively. Different methods and strategies could surprise our lives in different ways.

I am currently a junior computer science major at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, I am also studying aboard at the University of Notre Dame.

Integrating my daily life with programming is my motive. I believe the existence of programming is to increase the efficiency of our work. Creating different programs to make my life much easier is what I am striving for.
